    <p>This is a starter kit I made because I don&apos;t really like starter kits... ðŸ™„</p>

    <p>
      Anyway, I realized most of my projects end up with a very similar set up, and I got tired of
      spending a few hours doing that each time I started something new. Architecture in a React app
      is most of the time a matter of personal preference, and this boilerplate includes the
      features that I prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are looking for a more general, well-written starter kit, you probably should have a
      look at <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a>.
